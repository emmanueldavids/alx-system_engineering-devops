# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

**Issue Summary:**

**Duration:** June 10, 2023, 08:00 AM - June 11, 2023, 10:00 AM (UTC-5)

**Impact:** The web application experienced intermittent service disruptions, resulting in slow response times and occasional downtime. Approximately 30% of users were affected, leading to a degraded user experience and potential loss of revenue.

**Root Cause:** Database Connection Pool Exhaustion

**Timeline:**
* **Issue Detected:** May 10, 2023, 08:00 AM - Monitoring alerts indicated increased response times and error rates.
* **Actions Taken:** The engineering team investigated the system components, focusing on the web server, application server, and database.
* **Misleading Investigation:** Initially, the team suspected a misconfiguration in the load balancer, which was thoroughly examined, but no issues were found.
* **Escalation:** As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the database administration team for further analysis and support.
* **Resolution:** After extensive investigation, it was discovered that the root cause of the issue was an exhausted connection pool in the database server.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
* **Root Cause:** The application's connection pool was not properly configured to handle the increasing number of concurrent requests, leading to the depletion of available connections in the database server.
* **Resolution:** To address the issue, the connection pool configuration was optimized to accommodate a higher number of concurrent connections. Additionally, a monitoring system was implemented to track connection pool usage and alert the team in case of reaching critical levels.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
* **Improvements/Fixes:** 
Implement automated scaling for the connection pool to dynamically adjust based on traffic demands.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to proactively identify connection pool exhaustion and other performance bottlenecks.
Establish load testing procedures to simulate high-traffic scenarios and validate system performance.
* **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
Update the connection pool configuration to allow for a larger number of concurrent connections.
Implement database connection pooling best practices and optimize resource allocation.
Conduct a comprehensive review of the entire web stack architecture to identify potential scalability and performance improvements.

In conclusion, the web stack outage incident was caused by an exhausted database connection pool. The issue was detected through monitoring alerts and escalated to the appropriate teams for investigation. After identifying the root cause, the connection pool configuration was optimized, and additional monitoring measures were implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future. To further improve system resilience, several corrective and preventative measures were identified, including automated scaling, enhanced monitoring, and load testing procedures. By implementing these tasks, we aim to enhance the stability and performance of our web application, providing a better user experience for our customers.
